Welcome to Project Tarta! This is a turtle management system designed to simplify the management and tracking of turtles within an aquarium. Whether you're a turtle enthusiast or an aquarium caretaker, this Java-based application with a Postgres SQL database integration is here to make your life easier.

## How It Works

**Inserting Tarta**: With Project Tarta, you can effortlessly add turtles to the database. Simply provide the necessary information about the turtle, such as its name, species, age, and any other relevant details. The system will securely store the data for easy access and tracking.


**Exploring the Aquarium**: Take a virtual dive into the aquarium and explore the captivating world of turtles. The application provides a user-friendly interface where you can conveniently view all the turtles residing in the aquarium. Get to know each turtle, their characteristics, and their unique stories.


**Re-admitting Tarta**: Sometimes turtles need to be temporarily removed from the aquarium for various reasons, such as medical treatment or habitat adjustments. Project Tarta allows you to easily re-admit a turtle back into the aquarium once it's ready to return. Update the turtle's status and seamlessly reintegrate them into their aquatic home.

* Install Java on your system if it's not already installed.
